# GifTastic

In this project, you can search for GIPHY art by entering a search topic of your choice.  I started with marine animals, as they are my favorite!

The page includes an API call to GIPHY.com that will return 10 still images related to the choosen topic.  As the user clicks on the GIF, it will allow the animation to take effect.

Technologies used include:
1) jQuery
2) Bootstrap
3) JavaScript
4) AJAX
5) GIPHY API

Go ahead and give it a try yourself!!
